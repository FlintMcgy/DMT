# Dynamic Mission Toolkit (DMT) for DCS World

The **Dynamic Mission Toolkit (DMT)** is an expanding library of ready-to-use mission scripts for [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/).  
Each script is **standalone**, **plug-and-play**, and can be dropped directly into your missions without rewriting core logic.

You can use a single script, combine several, or integrate them into larger dynamic missions.  
No unnecessary dependencies â€” each script lists its own requirements.

## âš¡ Quick Start (General)

Most DMT scripts follow the same basic setup:

1. **Place the script** in your mission folder.  
2. **Open the Mission Editor** and create any required zones, units, or triggers mentioned in the scriptâ€™s description.  
3. **Add a Trigger:**  
   - Type: `MISSION START`  
   - Action: `DO SCRIPT FILE`  
   - File: `YourScript.lua`  
4. **Save and run the mission** â€” the script will start automatically.

- Optional player notifications when zones are captured  
- Works entirely with **DCS Scripting API** â€” no MOOSE or MIST required
